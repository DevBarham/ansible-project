## Introduction

This Ansible Project repository serves as a foundation for creating and managing infrastructure using Ansible playbooks and roles. Whether you're managing a small cluster of servers or orchestrating complex deployments, this repository can help you get started with best practices and reusable configurations.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Ansible: Make sure you have Ansible installed on your local machine or control node. You can download and install Ansible from [here](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/installation_guide/intro_installation.html).
- Access to target systems: Ensure you have SSH access to the target systems you intend to manage using Ansible.

### Installation

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/DevBarham/ansible-project.git
   cd ansible-project
   ```

### Configuration

Before running Ansible playbooks, you need to configure some settings. 

1. Review the `inventory.ini` file to define the target hosts and their connection information (IP address, SSH username, SSH key, etc.).

2. Modify playbook files in the `playbooks` directory to suit your specific needs. These playbooks define the tasks and configurations that will be applied to your target systems.

## Usage

To use this repository, follow these general steps:

1. Configure your inventory by editing the `inventory.ini` file.

2. Customize the playbooks in the `playbooks` directory to match your requirements.

3. Run Ansible playbooks using the `ansible-playbook` command:

   ```bash
   ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbooks/my_playbook.yml
   ```

   Replace `playbooks/my_playbook.yml` with the path to the playbook you want to run.

For more detailed usage instructions and examples, refer to the Ansible documentation.

## Directory Structure
